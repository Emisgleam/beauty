  <h1>Rotimi Opeyemi</h1>
  <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/emisnaturals/">Emis Naturals LLC</a></strong>.</em></p>
  <p>I am Rotimi Opeyemi Gbemisola, a graduate of Environmental Biology and
    Fisheries from Adekunle Ajasin University. I have my second degree from
    the University of Ibadan in Zoology (Parasitology). I am the lead
    formulator and creative director of Emis Naturals botan ical skincare
    products; a startup skincare brand in Nigeria with the vision
    of producing skincare products that help people to achieve a flawless
    skin with the aim of reducing product residue in people by shifting from
    the use of harmful skincare products (synthetic chemical) in the product
    formulation to using organic and botanical materials. I started my
    journey in the skincare industry sometimes in 2017. I was driven
    by the desire to have a flawless skin. As a teen, I was plagued with
    acne which resulted in hyper pigmentation and uneven skin tone and this
    condition took a toll on my self esteem. Back then I tried a lot of
    products on my skin but I didnâ€™t get the desired result.
    So, in 2017, I came about the African black soap. I used it in its
    natural form and I love the result and effect on my skin. So the idea
    popped in my head to modify the black soap by adding other natural
    ingredients that are very good on the skin to it to achieve a better
    result. That was how the journey started and itâ€™s been an incredible
    journey with
    so many ups and down and the problem of finding a niche for my products
    in the competitive skincare industry.</p>

  <h3> What we do</h3>
  <p>Emis naturals is an emerging skincare brand in Nigeria born of the
    desire to help people of colour to achieve a flawless and glowing skin.
    Our mission is to provide affordable luxury for all and sundry.At Emis
    Naturals, we formulate and produce skincare products with good
    botanical products to give and enhance glowing skin. All our skincare
    products are handmade and are made with natureâ€™s finest resources.
  </p>

  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p>The internet is saturated with lots of information.
    But in order to filter and verify these informations we get via
    internet, we consult skincare books written by seasoned dermatologist
    and we also experiment with the product. That is; we produce them, test
    them, and adjust them before introducing to the general public.</p>

  <h3>How i acquired the knowledge</h3>
  <p>I started up by learning on my own. Since I have skin issues, I know few
    skin hacks from reading skincare articles and doing online research.
    So I started formulating with the little knowledge I had. Picking up
    products and combining them together for a better result.
    When I got the first batch of my African black soap, I got some botanical
    powders from the market and incorporated them into the soap and
    I packaged it and sold them to people. But as time went by, I saw a need
    to improve my product, so I enrolled for several online skincare classes
    where I learnt various things. Some of which I discarded after thorough
    research. I enrolled for skincare classes with a skincare formulator
    which assisted me to improve my product knowledge in organic, botanical
    and pro mixing aspects of skincare and it also improved my knowledge of
    product formulation, branding and packaging. </p>
  <h3>Skills</h3>
  <p>I have various skills which are skincare formulation, facial make over
    and weave/ wig installation.</p>
